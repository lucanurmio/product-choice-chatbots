      "\n",
      "Bought a lot of batteries for Christmas and the AmazonBasics Cell have been good.\n",
      "I haven't noticed a difference between the brand name batteries and the Amazon Basic brand.\n",
      "These do not hold the amount of high power juice like energizer or duracell, but they are half the price..\n",
      "AmazonBasics AA AAA batteries have done well by me appear to have a good shelf life.\n",
      "I find amazon basics batteries to be equal if not superior to name brand ones.\n",
      "When I first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them.\n",
      "Use it for my fish tank's light at night and works great, I love how you can easily switch it off and on if you want it on while guests are there..\n",
      "Thankful that I was able to find on Amazon for a great price and even better shipping.\n",
      "I don't know if I would buy thus brand again seems like they don't last as long as Duracell.\n",
      "In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras.\n",
      "Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels.\n",
      "In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking..\n",
      "They don't last as long as the brand name but are good enough considering they are much cheaper..\n",
      "Bought these batteries for my Christmas gifts the month of (december) only lasted like 2months toys now need replacement batteries .\n",
      "Tv Remote control is still working but these batteries don't last very long....\n",
      "This my second order and they seem to work as good as name brand and ship to my door..\n",
      "This was my second purchase of amazon batteries and they work great.\n",
      "Just as good or even better than name brand batteries and half the price.\n",
      "They last as long as Duracell batteries in my Xbox one controllers and none of them exploded like some of the reviews said..\n",
      "These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!.\n",
      "HAVE NOT HAD CHANCE TO USE ALL OF THEM BUT HOPEFULLY ALL OF THEM WILL REMAIN IN GOOD ORDER FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME MEANING A FEW YEARS OUT..\n",
      "I use these batteries in my game cameras and they work great, last several weeks..\n",
      "Very convenient to have a box of batteries and at a good price.\n",
      "They seem to work okay so far and the price was great..\n",
      "We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week.\n",
      "First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands.\n",
      "I buy AAA and AA batteries about 4 - 6 times a year.\n",
      "These batteries work just as well as any of the name brands, but at a much more reasonable cost..\n",
      "I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day.\n",
      "They power many things and these work as good or better than any others..\n",
      "Amazon batteries are not only affordable, but have a long life..\n",
      "These work better than name brand batteries and cost nothing.\n",
      "Jn. AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar.\n",
      "on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way.\n",
      "For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data.\n",
      "For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's.\n",
      "but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer.\n",
      "If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's.\n",
      "It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon).\n",
      "My kids toys aren't that super powered and even in remotes I was having to change batteries way too often.\n",
      "A battery is a battery these work just as good if not better than the name brands like Duracell or Enginzer.\n",
      "These worked out great for his battery powered cars I got him.\n",
      "I used to buy batteries from Costco which come under Kirkland brand.\n",
      "Now my kids have more time to play with toys before the need to replace the batteries.\n",
      "They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries..\n",
      "This large pack of batteries is a cheap alternative to buying other brand names and are particularly useful for gaming.\n",
      "The battery life is every bit as good as the brand name batteries as well.\n",
      "These batteries are a good value and work well.\n",
      "Batteries are pretty much of a commodity as long as they do what they're supposed to do, so I ordered these based on their price -- much cheaper than what you can buy in a store.\n",
      "These Amazon batteries seem like a good value..\n",
      "Works great for everyday AA battery needs.\n",
      "I got tired of running back and forth to the local store to buy a small package of batteries therefore, I decided to order these since the cost for all of these batteries were approximately the same cost for 6 batteries in a pack.\n",
      "The price was right and the batteries are working very well.\n",
      "Great buy for the money - these batteries work very well.\n",
      "A great deal, and the batteries have a good life to them.\n",
      "Between LeapPads, Xbox controllers and remotes, we use batteries a lot.\n",
      "You know those crazy cheap batteries that are so light you practically hit yourself in the face when you pick one up These aren't those.I've already purchased a couple sets of these and have been really happy with the quality/lifespan.\n",
      "Worked exactly as they are supposed to, good price, good quality.\n",
      "lasting a nice long time, A good buy..\n",
      "I've been buying AAA alkaline batteries in packages of four at the dollar store and thought I was getting a pretty good deal on the price, but it bothered me to have to throw away so much packaging every time I needed four batteries.\n",
      "He (or she, I can't remember) claimed these work as well or better than name brands and are even less expensive than the dollar store deals and with much less waste in the packaging.So I ordered some and his advice was right on the money.\n",
      "Amazon claims 10-year, no-leak shelf life for them, but even I use batteries faster than that.I think this is a great product at a great price and I love the packaging.\n",
      "I ordered the 48 pack of AA batteries and its so much cheaper than a much smaller branded pack from the big chain stores.\n",
      "Ive tested these on several devices so far and they appear to be comparable to brand name batteries, they last a long time and bring all my electronics to life with renewed vigor.\n",
      "The pump uses 4 AA batteries and that is the way the Amazon batteries are packaged.\n",
      "My pump runs perfectly with these batteries.These batteries are said to have a shelf life of ten years so I won't be having to buy more AA batteries for at least that long.\n",
      "Great battery just as good as the name brands..\n",
      "These batteries are as good or better than any brand of alkaline battery on the market today..\n",
      "This probably the only way I'll be buying batteries at a good price too..\n",
      "Works just as well as any other battery brand we have bought!.\n",
      "These batteries are as good as other brands and a bargain to boot..\n",
      "They have lasted just as long as the big name brands, and they are a lot cheaper.\n",
      "They are just as good as any high priced battery..\n",
      "Another great offer from Amazon that delivers perfarmance and price for your electronic agenda 1.\n",
      "I was looking for affordable AA batteries with a long shelf life that I could keep around for an emergency or extended power outage.\n",
      "These Amazon alkaline batteries are advertised as having 10 years shelf life, and after receiving them I confirmed that on each battery is printed the expiration year 2025, which is what I expected having bought them in 2015.Now I won't have to by ordinary batteries that end up discharging internally in just a few years.\n",
      "These are really good batts and a great price..\n",
      "Excellent batteries and it's a better value than buying the batteries in smaller packs.\n",
      "These work just fine and were purchased at a good price..\n",
      "They last just as long as the top name brand battery for a fraction of the price.\n",
      "I have been using these batteries for some time now and they seem to be holding up as well or better than any name brand I have used in the past.\n",
      "The price, packaging and shelf life make Amazon batteries a winner..\n",
      "Good price, but most likely will not buy again..\n",
      "Fair price and and lasts as long as the bunny ones..\n",
      "Energizer and Duracell brand lasted a month.\n",
      "You get what you pay for in life bht for the lrice and amount these are actually great one say or two days of strong power for flashlights or wireless headphones etc.\n",
      "Package was nice fast delivery thunking of actually buying different sizes for other electronics ...would definitly order again ...kinda like gas not premium or regular something like a plus ....lol i have tried all those other expensive brands thats supposed to last 10x more longer well by the time you pay for one pack and get maybe a months wirth depending on usage you could have a 100 of these and still have left over......just saying your not buying tires or brakes for your car so test them out they sell it in smaller amounts and subscdiption amount etc.....\n",
      "AAA batteries - lots of them, at an affordable price.\n",
      "These batteries are more affordable than brands at the store, and I can't tell a difference in performance..\n",
      "I have not run any specific testing, but so far, they have performed well, and appear to give good battery life..\n",
      "Just as good as name brands, lasts longer and no mercury..\n",
      "This is a great deal and they seem to last quite a long time!Have mine set up to be shipped every month definitely the best way to go!.\n",
      "Battery life is on-par w/ Energizer and Duracell, and like a zillion times cheaper..\n",
      "In the stores, you get half the amount of batteries for double the price.100 will re buy.work great.\n",
      "Don't buy your batteries from Wal-Mart when you can get more than twice as many for a cheaper price on Amazon..\n",
      "From my experience, Amazon products are pretty good quality.\n",
      "We use a battery operated sound machine for our son to sleep to, and these work just as long as the Duracell batteries we were originally using and I love that they come in 4 packs within the box, which is extremely convenient so we don't have batteries floating around once they fall out of the box..\n",
      "Good buy on batteries,long life..\n",

      "I primarily use them in my xbox 36 controller and they last as long if not longer than any other brand i have used.\n",
      "The price tag is so much lower that even if you didn't like them or felt that a major manufacturer was somehow better than this you probably still wouldn't regret the purchase.\n",

      "They last just as long as the name brand batteries, but are much less expensive..\n",
      "So why not 5 stars I haven't used them long enough yet to know their life expectancy, and it would have been more convenient to have the packaging to be resealable or with fewer in the same container.\n",

      "BAD BATCH NOT LASTING!Have been using these for the Roku Remote, and they are dying after just a few days of use.Have been happy with Amazon battery purchases in the past.Not sure if the quality is overall lower than it once was, or if this was just a bad batch..\n",

      "(Costco hits top rank in consumer reports, but I have not seen their amazon battery rating.)But ordering from amazon is so easy, and the quality is good.\n",
      "The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name brands, let alone budget batteries I've bought.\n",
      "For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charger, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available..\n",

      "Price can't be beat...batteries aren't great, but they're so cheap.\n",
      "They're normal batteries, I just love that I could order them online and have them shipped with the wireless mouse I ordered the same day and have them arrive at the same time!.\n",
      "Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days..\n",

      "I attempted to clean the contacts and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaked that the plastic and internals have a permanent coat of oxidation on it.\n",
      "The price is awesome for the quantity and they last just as long as name brand batteries..\n",
      "Hard to tell if they are as good as name brand until I use them for a while..\n",
      "I haven't had these batteries long enough to tell you if they last a long time or not but for the price you can't go wrong and I trust the Amazon basic batteries to be a better value than buying Energizer or Duracell batteries online that might come from a seller who is knocking them off from China.\n",
      "Batteries seem to last pretty long and the price was great.\n",
      "Batteries seem to work fine but they are packaged in multiples of 4 and it's an annoyance to break open a new pack each time.\n",
      "We have been using these batteries in some kids toys and they work fine.\n",
      "Batteries work fine and are less expensive then all of the others on Amazon for sell.\n",

      "Average batteries, functioning as expected, at a great price.\n",
      "I'll post about it I see they don't last very long, but I've gained a lot of trust in Amazon brand products so I'm fairly confident..\n",
      "Living in a remote control world like I do I use a pretty fair amount of batteries, I find that these Amazon brand batteries are just as good or better than the copper top, or energizer, the price is competitive with the other brands , Kirkland, acdelco, rayovac, the preform really well in all devices, and the shelf life is great, I would recommend highly,.\n",
      "Work like the top name brand products, but at a greatly reduced price.\n",
      "I purchased these batteries for an emergency since they had a long shelf life.\n",
      "I had expected to get a lot longer use out of them, considering other brands I only need to change every six months at earliest..\n",
      "These batteries are pretty woeful, though, lasting only about 1/2 as long as the Duracells I get in the grocery store..\n",
      "i am ready to do a full review on this product.Sins the package arrived in my house, i immediately take 2 aa battery and put it to my mac mouse,believe me mac mouse is 24/7 in use and it got me thru for 1 month and 1 week FEB / 19 - MAR / 25-26really good product.\n",
      "I prefer purchasing my batteries in bulk, so that I can buy them once and forget about them for the upcoming months (or year).\n",
      "AmazonBasics was, at the time of purchase, the most economical pack of AAA batteries.I haven't noticed any difference in time or quality of use.\n",
      "I don't use AAA batteries for many things, though, and for those that I do the items tend to last for quite some time on a pair of batteries, so I would not notice a change unless the batteries were really, really poor quality.\n",
      "These also store well - I have had no issues using some of these that my parents purchased years ago and they appear comparable to the pack I purchased recently.I've lately been really impressed with the quality of electronics that AmazonBasics offers.\n",
      "These Amazon AA batteries are better than other leading brands like Duracell or Energizer compared within the Alkaline category.\n",
      "I'm not sure about shelf life though as I never put aside a battery for that many years and tried it before, but I do believe these can last way longer than the other brands.\n",
      "The price for a pack of these is also the best value than going to any actual store to buy them as they tend to be expensive.\n",
      "So far, every one of these batteries worked just fine with full charges and no dead ones at all.\n",
      "Best product from amazon basics,packaging is super good and easy to use.\n",
      "These batteries were just as good as the top brand batteries my husband always buys...\n",
      "if you are running through batteries all the time because of kids toys (which was my case) this will be a good deal for you!\n",
      "BEST BATTERIES EVERSeriously, way better than the two big brands that I have been buying for years.My insulin pump goes through one of these every 1.5 months were an energizer battery lasts .75 months.\n",
      "I bought these for my Xbox one remotes because the other brands I would buy dies way too quickly.\n",
      "These test full charge while the ones i have been buying are already partially discharged bc u cannot tell how fresh they r, even when they are adv as good for 10 yrs..\n",
      "I also use their rechargeable AA batteries which last a lot longer than any Energizer or Duracell that I have ever used.\n",
      "Best value on batteries yet and surprisingly long lasting, high quality batteries by Amazon.\n",
      "Best battery deal out there, And they work just as good as the name brands like Duracell..\n",
      "I was happy to find that AmazonBasics offers AAA batteries at a bargain price so that I don't have to spend more money keeping myself alive.\n",
      "Type 1 diabetes is expensive in itself and I'm glad that I can save, even if it's just spare change, on the products I need to purchase to keep my insulin pump going.\n",
      "I find that these last just as long as name-brand batteries and have had no problems with them.\n",
      "In the future I will be using Amazon's Subscribe Save program now that I know how long the batteries in my insulin pump last.\n",
      "Overall, I would recommend these batteries if you regularly use AAA batteries and like to save money..\n",
      "They seem to last me just as long as Energizer and Duracell AA batteries at a fraction of the cost..\n",
      "Work as good as Duracel and cost less.\n",
      "They work just as well as top brands (Energizer, Duracell) and are like half the price.\n",
      "And it may just be my biased opinion, but they seem to last longer than the Duracell or Energizer batteries I buy at the store (maybe because they don't sit in inventory for goodness know how long).\n",
      "This has to be why you should buy AmazonBasics battery instead of other people cause their prices higher than in stores for a cheap medium grade battery.\n",
      "I a real person and feel free to ask the oddest question.AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (8-Pack) - Packaging May Vary.\n",
      "Great product, long lasting with a great price..\n",
      "I love AmazonBasics in general and this number of batteries at that price- you cannot even beat that at the dollar store even with their crappy low quality batteries..\n",
      "I have purchased Amazon batteries before and they last as long as the leading brands like Energizer or Duracell's for 3x less the cost.\n",
      "We normally buy CostCo batteries, so we don't by the Top brand anyway.\n",
      "If the top brand lasts to a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the best, longest lasting, battery life, and these only last to a 7 or 8 they are a great value anyway because they are 100 batteries for 22.\n",
      "Twenty-Two cents vs about 46 cents for the top brand is a pretty good deal in my book.Okay I might have to change batteries more often which I see is the only downside.Again it's all about value to me.\n",
      "As far as I can tell they last as long as the expensive main brands.\n",
      "These batteries are great, and a real value when you buy in bulk.\n",
      "If you buy many the packaging can be used for safe storage.The performance of these batteries is about what you would come to expect from Amazon.\n",
      "While I'm a big advocate for lithium batteries, sometimes you just need a less expensive option and these are always my goto brand.\n",
      "I looked at the math about the capacity and strength and longevity of different batteries and a lot of them are similar, including these, and these make the most sense price wise.I have tried HUNDREDS of rechargeable batteries and they get recharged a couple of times and then disappear.\n",
      "The simple packaging is a plus over store bought blister packed batteries too..\n",
      "They're an amazing value - buying Amazon batteries in bulk is the best deal I've found anywhere.\n",
      "This keeps you ready and stocked.I also like the way they're packaged - plastic wrap is easy to tear off, but holds together sets of 4, all boxed together.\n",
      "We go through a lot of AAA batteries for electronics like trackballs and remote controls these seem to be the most reliable and longest-lasting I've found.\n",
      "All the batteries last as long as leading brands for a fraction of the cost.\n",
      "They last a long time and you can't beat the price!\n",
      "What I found was that in our Wii controllers and Xbox controllers, the rechargeable packs would die after a few months (maybe last a year)...but then I would have spent so much on the packs that I wouldn't want to replace them, so they would stay in the charger longer and longer and when we wanted to play a game, we only got 10 minutes of play time until the rechargeable pack was dead.Then I bought batteries at Walmart (Duracell) and used those...but it was so long between changes that when we wanted to play a game 6 months later, only half the controllers worked!\n",
      "The s e area great for all of the times you need this size of battery.\n",
      "I feel like I get just as much out of these as the name brands and the price is fantastic.\n",
      "The batteries have lasted just as long as any name brand batteries that I have bought.\n",
      "Life seems to be as long in devices I use a lot, and they don't leak.\n",
      "They last longer than most batteries I have purchases and are much cheaper than competitor brands.\n",
      "Hold up really well in my son's toys, better than most so far and last a few days in my hubby's Xbox controller, but mind you the thing is hardly ever not in his hands so that's actually a pretty good span compared to others we've used..\n",
      "They last just as long if not longer than the top name brands at a much cheaper cost..\n",
      "I especially love that these come on my subscribe and save order and I no longer pay for batteries at the check out counter in the grocery store..\n",
      "I personally think that these batteries are as good as name brand ones for half the price!\n",
      "I primarily use these in my xbox one controllers and change batteries maybe twice a month of heavy play.\n",
      "I love that Amazon offers its own brand of products for an amazing price!\n",
      "These batteries work just as well as any other brand I've purchased from the store, if not better.\n",
      "I have a remote control that eats through batteries (it also powers headphones so I don't disturb my boyfriend while he's trying to sleep) and so far these have lasted longer than the Duracell batteries I've been using.\n",
      "The ones we used previously that came from the box store whose name begins with a C, have been known to leak acid in multiple applications, and so far these have been super in both AA and AAA sizes.\n",
      "I only use Energizer/Duracell for smoke/CO2 detectors.In some kids toys, these have out performed Rayovacs, however, one sale, Rayovacs tend to be cheaper.\n",
      "I usually only buy Duracell batteries that I purchase on sale through Groupon.\n",
      "I received a bad batch and it always takes so long to get them that I decided to give the Amazon batteries a try.\n",
      "Thank you Amazon for providing another quality product that worked as well as the most expensive brands out there at a reduced price.\n",
      "Amazon Basics batteries are the best, I use them specifically in my Kwikset KEVO among other things.\n",
      "Someone suggested I try AmazonBasics and so far I've only need four batteries in the time that I would have used 20 or more.\n",
      "When I use up the AAA size I have sitting around I'll get a box of those too in the AmazonBasics brand.\n",
      "I noticed with other batteries I was getting a lot less suction but with these it runs full power, just like I'd plugged it in the wall.I don't think I'll buy the name brand batteries anymore.\n",
      "Seems to work better and last longer in our flashlights then the name brands!.\n",
      "tested these batteries along side name brand in a handheld microphone and they actually preformed better and lasted longer then the big name brands..\n",
      "These batteries run just as long as the Duracell's I had before this purchase.\n",
      "I bought these based on the reviews and because the price was so good.\n",
      "I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Wireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic wireless mice), TV remotes and clocks.\n",
      "So far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried.\n",
      "I've been buying bulk packs of AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline Batteries for a few years now and my household expenditures on batteries have gone down by nearly half.\n",
      "I don't see any difference in the overall performance or life of these batteries when compared to Duracell or EverReady alkaline batteries and they cost quite a bit less..\n",
      "We burn through these at my office for wireless keyboards and mice, so I needed to restock at a good price.\n",
      "They worked great for my needs, and will return based on the price..\n",
      "So far so good, I'll try and let folks know if they don't last as long as branded batteries..\n",
      "bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week.\n",
      "I thought for the price I couldn't go wrong but these things hold their charge compared to any name brand.\n",
      "A better deal here (Amazon) than the Duracell box, hope they perform as well too.\n",
      "I'm no battery expert, but based upon using these in the same devices that I've used name brand batteries, I notice no difference in performance.\n",
      "Batteries last just as long if not more than name brand for much higher price..\n",
      "These batteries have performed just as well as name brand batteries, and the price was very reasonable..\n",
      "I now have five times as many batteries as when I buy them at the grocery store, for the same price..\n",
      "what a good deal on batteries they work well.\n",
      "But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through.\n",
      "These are standard batteries and will last as long as any others you'll find, but at a MUCH better price than any store will have..\n",
      "I won't know if they leak until some time goes by,but I have had good luck with the unbrandedbatteries I purchased from Amazon in the past..\n",
      "I never use amazon batteries before,but I love it, It's good for the price,it last just as long as duracell batteries, and the design of the batteries is just cute.\n",
      "Pros: You can get a LOT of batteries for a very cheap price!Cons: Batteries do not last very long at ALL!I don't mind changing out batteries on something I use constantly since I got the hundred back, but it can get a little annoying doing it once a week.\n",
      "Still evaluating, but just bought some more because they work well with my applications and their price is the best..\n",
      "Haven't timed them or anything, but no particular difference noted between these and higher priced brand name batteries--are noticeably better than some more inexpensive ones I have bought in a pinch.\n",
      "I like the box they come in that is strong, but then they put hard plastic wrap on 4 packs of the battery that are a pain to remove.\n",
      "They last nearly as long as name brand, but the price is amazing.\n",
      "Non name brand batteries usually freak me out a little, but these actually work pretty well.\n",
      "I drain batteries pretty fast, and so far these hold up like Duracell..\n",
      "Maybe you can justify the pricing for certain situations.Should you use them for led string lights and hope they last a couple months Yep.Portable defribrilator No.RC car Sure.Camera for younger sister's wedding in the Greek Isles Nope.Vibrating nose hair trimmer Ok.Computer battery for your 17 hour flight to Siberia Nyet.Get my drift...\n",
      "If they had not been wrapped in packs of 4 batteries in cellophane, I would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to Amazon.None of the batteries was anywhere close to full power - they couldn't provide adequate power to anything I tried them in for any battery-powered item to work properly.\n",
      "great for the price but don't last long but the quantity makes up for it.\n",
      "they are fresh batteries and work great.\n",
      "Great batteries for super price!\n",
      "Long lasting and great packaging.\n",
      "As a new mom who depends on the quality and longevity of a good battery for her child's needs, I will never order this product ever again..\n",
      "Amazon basics batteries are definitely worth the buy!\n",
      "These batteries perform just like the others!These of been tested in everything from small toys, two Xbox controllers.\n",
      "Please do not die unexplainably or unexpectedly and they just plain work!I'm ordering a larger package I think but the Subscribe and Save option is great for monthly restocking or a staple item used all the time!.\n",
      "We've found that they work best in computer accessories like a keyboard or mouse but do not last long in things like toy remote controlled cars.\n",
      "Anything that takes a big drain in short bursts off of them (like electric toy car motors) shortens the life of these batteries fast but things that only use a small amount of energy over a long period of time do a lot better.\n",
      "Some name brand batteries do very well with high drain electronics and last a lot longer than these but if you use these Amazon batteries on low draw electronics you'll get your money's worth.What I've found them good for: Keyboard, mouse, laser pointer, small LED flashlights, small noise making toys (plays music, electronic beeps)Not good for: Anything with an electric motor, toy cars, pencil sharpener, etc...They can be a good value depending on what you use them to power..\n",
      "Best Product Value , Amazon know what they doing (:Good price for quantity , for sure will buy more ..\n",
      "You cannot beat the price of Amazon branded batteries.\n",
      "They last just as long as any other top brand, but a much better value.\n",
      "For the same price as the cheapo brands, these AmazonBasics batteries are great quality.\n",
      "But the fact that I bought these already a few months ago and I'm currently typing on said keyboard with the first set I took from package tells me they should last long enough..\n",
      "We're big fans of the Amazon brand batteries in all sizes..\n",
      "Performance/longevity wise, these beat out most every generic battery I've used and keeps up with the big brands too.\n",
      "Great basic alkaline batteries at a terrific price..\n",
      "For this many batteries you'd have to pay twice this price if it was name brand.\n",
      "They ship in a nice little box that's easy to store, within the box, the batteries are separated into plastic-wrapped packs of 4..\n",
      "Other batteries with the same price would be much worse than this brand..\n",
      "Cant beat the price, and these batteries seem to last forever even with heavy use.\n",
      "Great value on amazon basic batteries..\n",
      "Work great and last just as long as others!.\n",
      "I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries.\n",
      "They are cheap and long lasting, and I'll never go back to picking up batteries at the store again..\n",
      "The brand Amazon Basics has tons of useful stuff all the way from batteries to laptop bags and more.\n",
      "They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them..\n",
      "Amazon brand batteries are very poor quality.\n",
      "These batteries last just as long as any other brand I've tried, and buying them in bulk is a great deal..\n",
      "Batteries seem to work just as well as name brand batteries but at a much cheaper price..\n",
      "Just as great as name-brand batteries!\n",
      "Every once in awhile though I have something that doesn't need the more expensive batteries or are exposed to rougher conditions like remotes or outside hose timers where I just want something disposable.\n",
      "Quality is good and above all else is the Price!Cheaper batteries if you buy the 100 pack and way way cheaper than costco!.\n",
      "Since when Amazon started selling their brand's battery I am a fan1 of it.\n",
      "These work just as well as the name-brands, come in easy to access packaging, and are a great value!\n",
      "I've used Amazon batteries for a couple of years in everything from remotes, toys, flashlights, noise cancelling headsets, and portable games and have been very pleased.\n",
      "The performance is comparable to what you get out of the leading major brands at a fraction of the price.\n",
      "Compared to dollar store like batteries these seem to be better but not like twice as good.\n",
      "For the price and quantity it's worth the purchase.Use them in tv remotes to chess computers to kids toys and can't complain.\n",
      "Something as simple as a pack of batteries brought to you by Amazon at a more than competitive price delivered to your door.\n",
      "great price and now I have them on hand whenever I may need a battery!.\n",
      "Cheap and easy batteries in an easy open package that is also recyclable and good for storage.\n",
      "Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly.\n",
      "Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store.\n",
      "They work great and appear to have a long life..\n",
      "They last about as long as name brand batteries in my Xbox controllers, TV remote, and my expansive AmazonBasics adult toy collection.\n",
      "If you, like me, dont care what batteries you use in your TV remote these are fine for youPros-Um 100 batteriesThey come in packs of 4, so not loose batteries rolling aroundCons-I hear they may drain quicker than more expensive batteries.\n",
      "I ended-up going to Radio Shack and purchasing one of their batteries instead.I can only imagine that most of the 5-star reviews for this product are based off initial impressions and short-term use.\n",
      "seriously, you want me to change the batteries, it's a freaking TV stick what could possibly be wrong, the batteries are brand new and came with the device.\n",
      "I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem.\n",
      "I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long.\n",
      "Luckily, Amazon's return policy is amazing but I doubt I'll try another one of their Basics brand items anytime soon..\n",
      "These batteries don't last as long as the top brands, but for the price I can't complain too much..\n",
      "They don't seem to last quite as long as Duracell or Energizer, but for the price I will continue to buy..\n",
      "Decent batteries for a great price, idk if they last as long as energizer but so far so good, I will order more for Christmas for sure..\n",
      "It's now about the middle of April and I bought these at the end of February, I waited to post my review so I could get a better feel for these and how they last and how they compare to other batteries I've been using.We use a lot of batteries in our house so I buy bulk and these seemed like a good deal and they were or are.These seem to last just as long as other batteries I've used in terms of usage time so no complaints there at all.\n",
      "Just kidding but really i work in entertainment so we use pro cells but I bought a box of these just to keep handy and save the day when pro cells are not available.\n",
      "I am now trying to use the batteries and basically they are not working.\n",
      "The price is fantastic and they work just as well as certain name brand batteries with the copper top and the bunny..\n",
      "I'm always looking for a quality product at a great price, and I really feel like these have the longevity to do that.\n",
      "These batteries are usually a good buy for the money.\n",
      "We expected to get about 2-3 months of use based on the energizer batteries that came with the lock, but batteries died in 2 weeks..\n",
      "I'm constantly having to change them and sometimes the brand new batteries don't work..\n",
      "Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you'd be better off buying a quality brand..\n",
      "Hi ordered these thinking they were a great price, but sadly they die very quickly..\n",
      "I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries.\n",
      "i have purchased before great long lasting very powerful.\n",
      "At the same time I also purchase ACDelco Batteries because Amazon would only allow the purchase of one box.\n",
      "I'm glad I did because the ACDelco batteries worked great!\n",
      "Batteries are notably less long-lived compared to other brands.\n",
      "The price was right but they just don't last as long as the other name brand batteries so it's not worth it..\n",
      "The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading.\n",
      "Batteries don't last that long I bought these for some of the little round lights that go in your closets or under your cabinets they didn't make it a week which was sad..\n",
      "Bought these batteries thinking they were a good price.\n",
      "Because paying 20-40 dollars at Walmart (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right If you are like me and have 3 kids that all have annoying gizmos and electronic crap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer.\n",
      "I didn't conduct an official experiment, but they seem to work just as good as any other batteries out there.\n",
      "With other brand I can use the item several times before I have to replace the battery..\n",
      "Keep the power just the same as the much higher priced Duracell and Energizer batteries.\n",
      "Haven't noticed any difference in performance since I switch from my (brand name), big difference in price though.\n",
      "These batteries don't even work in a Amazon Firestick!.\n",
      "I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results..\n",
      "Why spend more on other brand name batteries when you can get these for a fraction of the price and they work really well..\n",
      "I'm sure they might be fine for using around the house, but for what I purchased them for (using with my external flash) these are the worst batteries I've ever used.Won't purchase them again.The black ones that are supposed to be better are also horrible for photographers.Household use only..\n",
      "Never put a review online about a purchase , but this Amazon battery leak so badly I have to discard all of them after 2 weeks of use, DON'T BUY THIS ITEM .....\n",
      "I use it for the roku remote and it runs out so fast, holds for about 2-3 weeks (just like the chineese batteries),.\n",
      "Good price but batteries just don't last as long as name brands.\n",
      "This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train..\n",
      "I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these..\n",
      "After using two sets of these, I am going to agree with other reviewers and say that they don't last as long as name brand batteries..\n",
      "I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energizer, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock..\n",

      "And they are the brand that the membership store sells so I can get them at a reasonable price whenever Im shopping for supplies.I took a chance on buying Amazon Basics brand for a couple of reasons.\n",
      "They are bulk packed, which is great, why pay more for fancy packaging on something as mundane as a battery And theyre fresh you know thats going to be true with Amazons immense daily turnover of product.\n",
      "I dont really care, theres no way a box of batteries is going to sit on my shelf for 10 years but it does mean that when I get to the 48th battery out of a package of 48 it probably will be nearly as fresh as the first one in the pack.I havent been able to see any downsides, and I do like saving money that would be wasted for fancy packaging and expensive advertising, so unless something drastically changes I believe these will now be my brand of choice..\n",

      "I love it when Amazon brings out commonly used products under their own name that perform well and are priced right.\n",
      "These AAA batteries are just another example of Amazon's buying power and smart branding.\n",
      "Because why would any company put their name (and reputation) on a product if they weren't convinced that it would be a true value to consumers The last thing that they want consumers to do is identify Amazon with anything but quality.So buy these knowing that they are a good value and work properly.\n",
      "I can't tell you how they are tested or at what point a battery is rejected but I can tell you that there are only certain types of batteries that I will buy because I don't believe in throwing away money and I Amazon batteries are right up there with my other 2 brands.\n",

      "I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries..\n",
      "Relatively inexpensive (I guess the multiplack of Kirkland batteries sold by Costco would be cheaper, but I didn't want to buy a ton of these, I needed them quickly and they were delivered right to my Mom's house in two days....well worth it), and they seem to work well...only time will tell if they hold up in the Fulcrum 30010-301 LED Battery-Operated Stick-On Tap Light, Silver, 3 Pack I purchased along with them.\n",

      "If you aren't seeking rechargeable, I haven't ever been able to distinguish any real difference in quality or longevity between these and other top brands of batteries (Duracell, Energizer, etc.).Between my kids toys and my Xbox controllers, we go through about all of these batteries in about 6 months, so subscribe and save is the way to go..\n",

      "It is not unusual for knockoffs to lead acid into your equipment or device, and even to explode!So, I know that with AmazonBasics, I'm getting a safe and reputable brand.Perhaps if I were buying from a national bricks and mortar store, I would choose Duracell or Energizer.\n",

      "It was also awesome to be able to get them in 2 days, since our TV buttons are very hard to use so the shorter time without a remote, the better!Work great.\n",
      "Great prices and I believe the Amazon brand works just as well as any.\n",

      "For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's.\n",
      "but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer.\n",
      "If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's.\n",
      "It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon).\n",
      "A battery is a battery these work just as good if not better than the name brands like Duracell or Enginzer.\n",
      "They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries..\n",

      "a good stock pile of batteries for a decent price.\n",
      "Works great for everyday AA battery needs.\n",
      "I got tired of running back and forth to the local store to buy a small package of batteries therefore, I decided to order these since the cost for all of these batteries were approximately the same cost for 6 batteries in a pack.\n",

      "The expiration date on these Amazon basics AAA's is 2027 so I expect them to have a good shelf life I believe these batteries will perform every bit as well as the energizers I last purchased.\n",
      "From the reviews I've read I would highly recommend purchasing these batteries over any name brand for General use purposes as I'm not sure how they would stand up too I drain situations.\n",

      "For running on batteries, this light is super bright and works awesome.\n",
      "But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through.\n",
      "Work as well as major brands, as far as I can tell, but for a much better price..\n",

      "love amazon batteries..great quality, great price.\n",
      "For the same price as the cheapo brands, these AmazonBasics batteries are great quality.\n",
      "But the fact that I bought these already a few months ago and I'm currently typing on said keyboard with the first set I took from package tells me they should last long enough..\n",

      "Since when Amazon started selling their brand's battery I am a fan1 of it.\n",

      "So that's good I guess as its still very bright, just not new, never been used bright.Usually I replace 1 out the 3 batteries every 3 weeks.\n",
      "I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem.\n",

      "I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries.\n",
      "The AA's I bought got remotes last a third as long as everready batteries..\n",
      "Put them in a different clock, same results, time was off by 10 minutes within a few days, put them in a battery op shaver, which the other brands most of the time last at least a month, these lasted about a week.\n",
      "Got the 20 pack, not sure if it was a bad batch but we do not recommend these batteries and wont buy them again.\n",

      "The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading.\n",
      "Because paying 20-40 dollars at Walmart (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right If you are like me and have 3 kids that all have annoying gizmos and electronic crap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer.\n",
      "My remote controls won't even work with the brand new batteries in place.\n",

      "Great deal price wise but don't seem to last very long at all.\n",
      "This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train..\n",
      "I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these..\n",
      "Don't last quite as long, but DAMN, you can buy three times as many as leading batteries.\n",
      "I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energizer, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock..\n",
      "Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Prime.\n",
      "Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell.\n",
      "The quality is comparable to most other brands we've tried - especially for video game controllers and the like..\n",
      "But I opened and tried to use them as soon as I got them and had problems.I checked the batteries and they only had 1.25 volts upon delivery and of course they are non returnable.Don't waste your money on these, go ahead and pay a little more and get the popular name brands..\n",
      "Won't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detectors with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell.\n",
      "But with the Amazon batteries, it gets up to like medium speed and doesn't even last 1/2 as long.\n",

      "Definitely cheaper than buying from big box stores and work just as well..\n",
      "Why pay more for batteries when these work just fine and are cheap!\n",
      "A lot cheaper than any other brands and you get the same good quality.\n",
      "i now use AA and AAA amazon batteries, great price, same quality as name brands..\n",
      "These Amazon Basic batteries are just as good as the expensive name brand.\n",
      "I am often surprised when I change batteries in a high-use device and realize how long these batteries last.\n",
      "Great price and lasts just as long as leading brands of batteries..\n",
      "Super excellent bulk pricing.Batteries are batteries and these work just as good as the big name brands.Have you seen the battery prices latley in retail stores Outrageous.\n",
      "Theses amazon branded, bulk, prime shipping simply cannot be beat in quality and cost.Stock up!\n",
      "Or not because you get them in a few days Prime shipping, no worries.They come in a nice compact package, and groups of batteries are shrink wrapped together for neat storage.Never buy those big names again!\n",
