       "\"My roommates stole them all and never complained! great price and long lasting same as above batteries, great price and long lasting and appreciate quality and great price these are the only AA batteries i buy now, great price and outlasts any of the batteries from the big box stores I haven't tested them to compare to other brands, but the Amazon batteries are a great price and great packaging. I never use amazon batteries before,but I love it, It's good for the price,it last just as long as duracell batteries, and the design of the batteries is just cute Pros: You can get a LOT of batteries for a very cheap price!Cons: Batteries do not last very long at ALL!I don't mind changing out batteries on something I use constantly since I got the hundred back, but it can get a little annoying doing it once a week. I will never buy batteries from anywhere else Good batteries, just as great as name brand but for a cheaper price Good batteries, the humble packaging makes them cheaper than other brands too good batteries, they last long time.\""
